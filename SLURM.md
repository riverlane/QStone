# SLURM and QPU resources

SLURM allows the definition of custom resources (generalised resources) that the scheduler uses to handle job scheduling and execution.
One possible way to introduce the concept of Quantum Computers as a shared resource requires three steps:

1. As administrator include a `gres.conf` file in the Slurm configuration folder. In this file define the quantum computer resource. A possible implementation:

```
# Configure 1 QPUs. The scheduler can only decrement (or restore) the resource counter
NodeName=my-worker Name=qpu Count=1 Flags=CountOnly
```

2. Modify the `slurm.conf` file to include the GRES resources. Append at the end of the file the entry `Gres=qpu:1` previsiously defined in the `gres.conf`. 
Note: the name of the workers must match.

```
# Server configuration
GresTypes=qpu
NodeName=my-worker Gres=qpu:1 CPUs=108 Sockets=1 CoresPerSocket=108 RealMemory=32000 NodeAddr=127.0.0.1 State=UNKNOWN
PartitionName=RL1 Nodes=my-worker Default=YES MaxTime=INFINITE State=UP
```
 
3. QStone can now be told to generate a benchmark in which the SLURM runner leverages the GRES=qpu during the phase of active engangement with the QPU by setting 
qpu_management=SCHEDULER in the `config.json` file. This will add the request to use a gres=qpu into the srun call.
